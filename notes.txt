*How to make two player*

game always starts with odd
if two player checked 
    then play even too


computer turn
    if odd number
        then play sequence1
    else if even number
        then play sequence2

player turns
    if odd number
        player1 follows sequence
            if player1 sequence == comp sequence
                then give score
            if not 
                then lose
    else if even number
        player2 follows sequence
            if player2 sequence == comp sequence
                then give score
            if not 
                then lose
